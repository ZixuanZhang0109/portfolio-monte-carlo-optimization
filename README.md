## Project Overview

Using a Monte Carlo approach, we simulate 700 return scenarios for the four selected assets. The simulation is based on a multivariate normal distribution defined by expected returns, standard deviations, and a correlation matrix.

Two strategies are evaluated:

- **Long Positions Only**: All portfolio weights are constrained to [0, 1] and sum to 1.
- **Shorts Allowed**: Portfolio weights may be negative (i.e., allow short selling) but still sum to 1.

For each portfolio, compute:

- **Expected Return**:

- **Portfolio Risk (Volatility)**:

The opportunity sets for both strategies are visualized on a risk-return plot.

## Data Files

- `asset_parameters.csv`: Contains expected annual return and standard deviation for each asset.
- `asset_correlations.csv`: Correlation matrix used to construct the covariance matrix for simulation.

You can modify these CSV files to explore other assets or parameter assumptions.
